                    <h3>Why is Preventive Care so important for my pet?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Prevention is the key to your pet’s long-term health. For that reason, the veterinarians
                        and medical team at Derry Animal Hospital recommend your pet receive a complete
                        wellness examination once a year.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If your pet has a health problem or issue that can be detected in its early stages,
                        there is a far greater likelihood it can be resolved and treated with less difficulty,
                        less expense and greater success.
                            To make sure we are providing your pet with the best possible care, we follow
                        the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) guidelines, standards and protocols
                        and our staff consistently works with outside specialists to ensure we are up to
                        date on the latest technology and cutting edge procedures. We also follow the guidelines
                        of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease (diseases
                        transmitted from animals to humans) transmission.

                    <p>
                        Regular examinations are our chance to assess your pet’s overall health, discuss
                        any changes we see, educate and update you on advancements in medical care and for
                        you to discuss any concerns or questions you may have. Derry Animal Hospital has
                        developed programs for every stage of your pet’s life to best meet the health needs
                        unique to your companion.

                    <h3>Balanced Vaccination Programs</h3>
                    <p>
                        Vaccinations are one of the most important ways you can keep your pet healthy and
                        free from disease. However, not every pet requires the same series or frequency
                        of vaccines. At Derry Animal Hospital, our veterinarians determine a vaccination
                        protocol based on your pet’s lifestyle, susceptibility to disease, geographic location,
                        and the most current recommendations from the American Animal Hospital Association.
                        Our goal to is to maintain optimal health and protection while not over-vaccinating
                        your pet.
