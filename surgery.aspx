                        The entire veterinary team at Victoria Vet Clinic understands the decision to allow
                        your beloved companion to undergo surgery is never easy. For your pet’s safety and
                        your peace of mind, we follow the strictest surgical guidelines to keep your pet
                        comfortable and help make the experience as stress free as possible for both of
                        you.

                        Perhaps the most important pre-surgical step is to discuss why we believe a particular
                        procedure is necessary and what it entails. Your veterinarian will provide you with
                        information on proper postoperative care and answer any questions you have so you
                        feel comfortable knowing you are making the right choice for your pet.

                    <p>
                        All orthopedic surgeries are performed by Victoria N. Clark, DVM, Diplomate ACVS,
                        a board-certified surgical specialist since 1992. In 1999 Dr. Clark founded Veterinary
                        Surgery of New England, a mobile surgical referral practice based in Durham, NH.

                        and soft tissue surgery services at veterinary hospitals in New Hampshire, southern

                    <h2><i class="fa fa-line-chart fa-5x"></i> Laser Surgery</h2><br />
                    <p>
                        Surgical lasers have become a vital part of veterinary medicine. In laser surgery,
                        a highly focused laser beam efficiently vaporizes the affected living tissue. It
                        simultaneously seals capillaries, small blood vessels, lymphatics and nerve endings.
                        All our veterinarians perform laser surgery, and most surgeries we offer can be
                        performed using a laser. Laser surgery has significant benefits to both pets and
                        surgeons.
                            <br />
                        Less Bleeding:As it makes an incision, the laser seals small blood vessels. The
                        result is a significant reduction in bleeding, which enables different surgical
                        procedures to be utilized for optimal results for your pet. 
                            Less Pain: The CO2 laser beam seals nerve endings and lymphatics, which results
                        in less edema and pain for your
                            pet. Less pain also means less post-operative recovery time for your pet. 
                            Reduced Risk of Infection: One of the most unique features of the CO2 laser
                        beam is that it efficiently kills
                            bacteria in its path, producing a sterilizing effect.

                    <h2><i class="fa fa-stethoscope fa-5x"></i> Customized Anesthesia Protocols</h2><br />
                    <p>
                        Ensuring the health and safety of your pet during surgery is our utmost concern
                        and requires an anesthetic and monitoring regimen that adheres to the highest principles
                        and ideals of quality care. We utilize a multi-parameter monitoring and anesthesia
                        system to ensure your pet’s safety during all surgeries. Prior to surgery, your
                        pet is examined and a pre-surgical blood screen is performed. The results of these
                        tests and your pet’s past anesthetic history, breed, age and weight, are used to
                        create an individualized anesthesia protocol for your pet. During surgery, your
                        pet is cared for by a well-trained and experienced veterinary technician using our
                        state-of-the-art monitoring system, which tracks blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory
                        rate, body temperature and oxygen level
                    </p>



                    <h2><i class="fa fa-medkit fa-5x"></i> Pain Management</h2><br />
                    <p>
                        We all know that pain hurts, but pain also has many other detrimental effects on
                        your pet’s body. Pain slows healing, decreases activity and can cause behavioral
                        changes such as aggression, anxiety and depression. Pain also worsens diseases like
                        arthritis and potentially some cancers, and it interferes with the bond between
                        you and your pet. 
For all these reasons, the team at Victoria Vet Clinic take controlling your pet’s pain very seriously.
                        As part of our commitment to keep your pet comfortable and protect the bond you
                        share, we administer a pain management regimen before, during and after surgery.
                        It is our goal to treat your pet’s pain before your pet even experiences discomfort.
                        For surgeries as well as for acute and chronic conditions, we use all our available
                        and safe resources, including local anesthetics, NSAIDs (non-steroidal medications)
                        and oral and injectable analgesics for your pet’s complete comfort.                        
                    </p>



                    <h2><i class="fa fa-life-saver fa-5x"></i> Caring for your pet after surgery</h2><br />
                    <p>
                        Following surgery, your pet is closely monitored and kept warm and comfortable by
                        a dedicated veterinary technician for a safe recovery. As your pet is discharged
                        from the hospital, you will be provided detailed information on how to administer
                        any medication and properly care for your pet after surgery. We are also available
                        to answer any questions or concerns that arise after you and your pet return home.
